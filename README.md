# My Projects
 I am kind of new to programing so I decided to learn python as it is one of the easier languages to get started with.
 Here are games I have made using python(and probably pygame)

 If there is an error where it cant find the sprites, sheck out the other mark down file (.md)
    
 space: spaceshoter with asteroids. my first pygame project even tho one of the more complex

 DVD: dvd screensaver

 pong: just pong game for 2 players. controls are w/s and up/down(arrows)
 
 flappy_birds: exactly s it sounds. I made flappy birds in py game. the hitboxes are a tiny
               bit weird tho
