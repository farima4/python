# My Projects
 I am kind of new to programing so I decided to learn python as it is one of the easier languages to get started with.
 Here are games I have made using python(and probably pygame)

 DVD: dvd screensaver(aint gonna hit the corner that easy)
 pong: just pong game for 2 players. controls are w/s and up/down(arrows)
 space: spaceshoter with asteroids. my first pygame project even tho one of the more complex
